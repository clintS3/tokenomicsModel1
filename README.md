# tokenomicsModel1
Model laid out by Zixuan Zhang: "On modeling blockchain-enabled economic networks as stochastic dynamical systems."

It does not use cadCAD. It is a single loop in time (length numTimeSteps) that goes thru the update equations laid out in the Zhang paper.

tokenomics_noCAD2_MC is the updated version to allow for Monte Carlo runs.
